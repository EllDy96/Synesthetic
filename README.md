# Synesthetic

## Abstract

The aim of the project is to render a visual representation of a musical piece via music information retrieval algorithms. The user is required to upload an audio track containing the rhythmically relevant sounds of a musical piece (e.g. drums).

Based on the rhythmic track, a dynamic visual representation is generated.

## Detailed project description

The project is divided into two main parts:
1. Backend (implemented in Python): takes a musical piece and performs its analysis and information retrieval
2. Frontend (implemented in JavaScript): takes in the data generated by the backend, generates visual elements and shows them dynamically together with the musical piece

Python and Javascript are integrated using Flask (see https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/installation/ and https://palletsprojects.com/p/flask/)


### Backend (Python)
Pre-analysis/extration of information from the audio track:
* Rhythm: a custom algorithm is used in order to extract all the periodicities inside the rhythm track. Polyrhythms are supported.

All information is extracted in the backend in order to optimize the realtime aspect of the visualization in javascript.
The extracted information is passed to the frontend as JSON objects that are interpreted simultaneously with the playback of the musical piece.


### Frontend (Javascript)
We visualize in a different way:
* Rhythms: since polyrhythms are supported, each rhythm can be associated to a different animation. The animations are triggered and pulsate following their relative rhythm
